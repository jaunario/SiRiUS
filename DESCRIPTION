Description: Simulate Rice Ubiquitous System (SiRiUS) is an application for running small to large-scale ORYZA rice crop model simulations. It is capable of leveraging on freely available soil and weather data. (In the near future, user-provided inputs can also be ingested by using tools to format them in ORYZA-readable files.)
